    <h1>1. Introduction to Thermodynamics</h1>
    <p>Thermodynamics, the study of heat, work, energy, and their effects on systems, forms the foundation of physical chemistry and explores the relationships between macroscopic properties such as temperature, pressure, and volume in equilibrium states.</p>

    <h1>2. What is Temperature?</h1>
    <p>Temperature, a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, is a property that determines thermal equilibrium between systems and is crucial for understanding heat transfer and energy flow. As defined by the zeroth law of thermodynamics, it provides a quantitative measure of the relative hotness or coldness of objects, with various scales and measurement techniques developed to accurately gauge this essential physical quantity.</p>

    <h1>3. The Concept of Mole</h1>
    <p>The mole, a fundamental unit in chemistry representing 6.02 Ã— 10^23 elementary entities, plays a crucial role in chemical thermodynamics by bridging the gap between microscopic particles and macroscopic measurements.</p>

    <h1>4. The Ideal Gases</h1>
    <p>Ideal gases play a crucial role in understanding thermodynamics, providing a simplified model that helps explain the behavior of gases under various conditions. This concept, which assumes gas molecules do not interact except through elastic collisions and have negligible volume, forms the foundation for key gas laws such as Boyle's Law and Charles' Law. These laws, in turn, combine to create the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT), a fundamental equation in thermodynamics that relates pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of a gas. </p>

    <h1>5. Equation of Gaseous State</h1>
    <p>The thermodynamic state of a gas is determined by the interplay of pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles present, as described by equations of state such as the ideal gas law and van der Waals equation.</p>

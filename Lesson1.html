    <h1>1. Introduction to Thermodynamics</h1>
    <p>Thermodynamics, the study of heat, work, energy, and their effects on systems, forms the foundation of physical chemistry and explores the relationships between macroscopic properties such as temperature, pressure, and volume in equilibrium states.</p>

    <h1>2. What is Temperature?</h1>
    <p>Temperature, a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, is a property that determines thermal equilibrium between systems and is crucial for understanding heat transfer and energy flow. As defined by the zeroth law of thermodynamics, it provides a quantitative measure of the relative hotness or coldness of objects, with various scales and measurement techniques developed to accurately gauge this essential physical quantity.</p>
